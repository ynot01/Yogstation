## DOWNLOADING

There are a number of ways to download the source code. Some are described here, an alternative all-inclusive guide is also located at https://wiki.yogstation.net/wiki/Downloading_the_source_code

Option 1:
Follow this: https://wiki.yogstation.net/wiki/Setting_up_git

Option 2: Download the source code as a zip by clicking the ZIP button in the
code tab of https://github.com/yogstation13/Yogstation
(note: this will use a lot of bandwidth if you wish to update and is a lot of
hassle if you want to make any changes at all, so it's not recommended.)

## The Yogstation codebase recommends compiling using version [514.1589](https://www.byond.com/download/build/514/514.1589_byond.exe) and may potentially NOT work on newer or older versions.

## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

Recently we have changed the way to compile the codebase.

Find `BUILD.bat` here in the root folder of yogstation, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile.

After it finishes, you can then setup the server normally by opening `yogstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon. See further down for instructions

**Building yogstation in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
