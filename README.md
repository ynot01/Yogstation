## :exclamation: How to compile :exclamation:

Recently we have changed the way to compile the codebase.

Find `BUILD.bat` here in the root folder of yogstation, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile.

After it finishes, you can then setup the server normally by opening `yogstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon. See further down for instructions

**Building yogstation in DreamMaker directly is now deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
