##	- When a player joins as a station job, they are set to earn that job's antag reputation
##	- At a certain time into the round, all players are checked
##	- Players that are dead, dying, or AFK are set to earn no antag reputation for that round
##	- When the round ends, all players are checked again
##	- Players that are on centcom and alive receive 2x antag reputation
##	- Players that are not on centcom and alive receive 1.5x antag reputation
