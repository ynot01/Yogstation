## Assets can opt-in to caching their results into `tmp`.
## This is important, as preferences assets take upwards of 30 seconds (without sleeps) to collect.
## The cache is assumed to be cleared by TGS recompiling, which deletes `tmp`.
## This should be disabled (through `CACHE_ASSETS 0`) on development,
## but enabled on production (the default).
CACHE_ASSETS 0
