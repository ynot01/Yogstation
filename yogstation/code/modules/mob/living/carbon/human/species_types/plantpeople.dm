		"From the very beginning, phytosian history was one drenched in blood. Originating from the planet of Muldova, \
		the first phytosians were created from the blood spilled by predators on the leaves of lazarupela vitalis. \
		Those first made, revived with the hazy and violent memories of their death, used their second chance at life \
		to take revenge on their predators or simply lash out at other beings, including their own kin. The first \
		phytosians killed and were killed during the day, then reborn anew the following morning via podseeds. \
		Eventually forming communities and a civilization, phytosians were nearly wiped out around the year 2005 \
		when the phytosian leader Grei of Banylid went mad after one of his countless resurrections and set to \
		incinerate all that existed to link the divine and mortal world. The ensuing worldwide war was dubbed \
		the Razing and resulted in the permanent death of more than 99% of the population at the hands of all \
		sorts of incendiary weapons. All podseeds that could bring them back were burnt too except for those grown \
		on a divine monument known as the Mother Tree. The main continent was wiped barren of life save the Tree, \
		until jars of blood crashed into it and spawned the few victors. The survivors formed the Gukdem Confederacy: \
		a government tasked with preventing such an event from happening again through strict authoritarian policies. \
		They quickly butchered almost all remaining non-phytosians lifeforms on Muldova in order to to assimilate them, \
		enclosing the rest to ensure a steady supply of population.",

		"In the year 2511, drones of Sano-Waltfield Industries landing on Muldova alerted phytosians of the existence \
		of other life elsewhere. They immediately desired to correct this situation, and shot the drones down. \
		Noticing the incident, SIC investigators went to scan the planet, expecting illegal human colonists. Instead, \
		they found a planet dominated by a highly armed and technologically advanced civilization. Both sides were \
		extremely cautious during their first contact, and a wideband radio communication was established in 2513. \
		After those initial interactions and both sides realizing that their interlocutors possessed a similar intelligence to them, \
		limited trade agreements were made between the SIC and the Confederacy, the latter enthusiastically trading lazarapela vitalis.",

		"Families do not exist among phytosians, and each individual is expected to be autonomous. Society is organized by disciplined, \
		constant work with few celebrations. Phytosians give no value to their lives, as death is seen as a minor inconvenience \
		at worst; it is a rather unremarkable event, since they'll be back soon. Violent, often lethal sports are not uncommon and \
		still remain popular among them today. Most notable is the phytosian's obsession with fire. Fire is both revered and \
		feared, as incineration is one of the only ways for a phytosian to truly die; it destroysthe podseeds under them and \
		evaporates blood.  It is a divine power, a destructive force, and an escape from the endless cycle of rebirth.",

		"Today, few embassies exist on Muldova, and anything shown to SIC denizens and representative is carefully \
		chosen and controlled. Cooperation and exchanges between the SIC and the Confederacy are almost inexistent. \
		The only phytosians seen in SIC space are generally political opponents to the Confederacy or have come to \
		observe the galaxy outside their system, intending on coming back to provide a full report. Phytosians \
		deciding to settle outside of Muldova willingly are a rarity, most of them being from other species that \
		were reincarnated by the podseeds and chose to keep a bond with their old civilization.",
