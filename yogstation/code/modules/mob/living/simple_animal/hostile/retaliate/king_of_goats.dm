KING OF GOATS

found in kinggoatarea.dmm

It has no ranged attacks but has the ability to summon guards, charge at its enemy and do an AOE explosion attack.
If defeated at stage three he will fall over dead on the ground and drop a ladder so you may now leave the arena. Will also drop loot.

The three stages of the king goat:
 Stage 1: Pretty much just a slightly more robust regular goat, the king will charge at you full force in the hopes of taking you out easily. Can easily be defeated.
 Stage 2: The king goat will become slightly larger and start doing special attacks, which range from summoning guards to stomping his hooves on the ground (causing the arena to shake and an AOE explosion to appear around him).
 Stage 3: The king goat will completely heal, grow slightly bigger and start glowing. It has the exact same attacks as stage 2 but is more aggressive overall.

The loot:
The king goat pelt: Gained by butchering the King Goat's corpse. When worn on your head grants complete bomb immunity. Has slightly better gun and laser protection than the drake helm at the cost of slightly reduced melee protection. Makes goats friendly towards you as long as you are wearing it.

Difficulty: Insanely Hard
